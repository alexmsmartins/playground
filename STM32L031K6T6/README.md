# The board

The processor `STM32L031K6T6`

- Installing CubeMX
- installing openocd with `brew install [--HEAD] openocd`
  - http://openocd.org/
- since I am on the MAC, I ended up installing `brew install arm-none-eabi-llvm` instead of the `gcc-arm-none-eabi` Monica and I installed on Windows.
- lets see if this works out ok.

# TODO

- [ ] try `gcc-arm-none-eabi` if `arm-none-eabi-llvm` does not work.
